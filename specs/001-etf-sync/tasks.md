**Checkpoint**: ETF list sync functional - ETFs stored with is_etf='Y' marker

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Add ETF Marker Query Support (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Database supports queries to filter and distinguish ETFs from regular stocks

**Independent Test**: Database queries can filter ETFs using is_etf field (WHERE is_etf='Y')

**Note**: This story is largely covered by Phase 1, but adds query/service layer support

### Implementation

- [ ] T026 [US2] Test ETFs can be queried by market (SH/SZ) with is_etf filter

**Checkpoint**: ETF marker query support ready - API can filter ETFs

---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Sync ETF Historical Price Data (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: System can fetch ETF daily price data and store in same price history table as stocks

**Checkpoint**: ETF price sync functional - ETF prices stored and queryable

---

## Phase 5: Sync API Integration (Updated Scope)

**Goal**: Add Flask API endpoints for triggering ETF sync operations (internal sync workflow only)

**Note**: Based on clarifications, this project maintains single responsibility: sync data from remote API to database. **No external query API endpoints** are provided. Phase 5 focuses on sync trigger endpoints for CLI/automation tools.

**Independent Test**: ETF sync can be triggered via Flask API and executes successfully

### Implementation

- [x] T041 [US1] Add POST /api/etf/lists endpoint for triggering ETF list sync in app/routes/sync_tasks.py
- [x] T042 [US3] Add POST /api/etf/prices endpoint for triggering ETF price sync in app/routes/sync_tasks.py
- [x] T047 [US1] Register sync_tasks blueprint in app/main.py (already registered, added ETF endpoint info)
- [ ] T048 [US1] Test ETF list sync endpoint triggers sync successfully
- [ ] T049 [US3] Test ETF price sync endpoint triggers sync successfully

**Checkpoint**: ETF sync API endpoints functional for triggering sync operations

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phase 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Database schema extension
2. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test is_etf field exists and can be queried
3. Deploy database migration

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP**: Phase 1 (Database field) - Basic ETF identification ready
2. **Increment 1**: Phase 2 (ETF List Sync) - ETFs can be fetched and stored
3. **Increment 2**: Phase 3 (Query Support) - ETFs can be filtered/queried
4. **Increment 3**: Phase 4 (Price Sync) - ETF prices available
5. **Increment 4**: Phase 5 (API Routes) - ETF data accessible via API
6. Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Phase 1**: Single developer (database schema, blocking dependency)
2. **Phase 2**: Once Phase 1 is complete:
   - Developer A: T008-T011 (ETF API fetcher)
   - Developer B: T012-T019 (ETF sync service)
3. **Phase 4**: Once Phase 2 is complete:
   - Developer A: T027-T030 (ETF price API)
   - Developer B: T031-T040 (ETF price sync)
4. **Phase 5**: Parallel development of different endpoints

### MVP Scope

- Provides foundation for future ETF features

**Recommended MVP**: Phases 1 + 2 (Database + ETF List Sync)
- Complete ETF list synchronization
- ETFs available in database for querying
- Foundation for price sync

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story can be independently completed and tested
- Commit after each logical group or phase checkpoint
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
- Avoid cross-phase dependencies that break story independence
